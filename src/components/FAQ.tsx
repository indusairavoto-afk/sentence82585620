      question: 'Is my data really kept local?',
      answer: "Yes. When you use the 'Converter' to extract text from your HTML or Share Links, the processing logic runs strictly within your browser. We do not have a backend server that receives or stores your conversation data."
    },
    {
      question: 'Where is the Vault data stored?',
      answer: "The Vault feature uses IndexedDB, a local database built directly into your web browser. Your data never leaves your device."
    },
    {
      question: 'Why do I need to use Ctrl+S to save HTML?',
      answer: "Using Ctrl+S (or Cmd+S on Mac) ensures you grab the fully rendered conversation from ChatGPT or Claude, including formatting. Standard Share Links don't always contain the full structured DOM tree in a way that’s easily parsed."
    },
    {
      question: 'Which platforms are supported?',
      answer: "We currently support parsing from ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini. If you find a structure that fails, please let us know so we can add support for it."
    },
    {
      question: 'Is Bridge free to use?',
      answer: "Absolutely. We rely on community donations to cover domain and hosting costs for the static site, but the tool will always remain completely free."
